# Tagged Apostolic Fathers

The goal here is to tag the text that has been cleaned up at <https://github.com/jtauber/apostolic-fathers>. As it stands, it is a WIP.

TODO List:

- [x] Lemmatize words (this uses Perseus where possible, augmented by [odyCy](https://centre-for-humanities-computing.github.io/odyCy/performance.html) lemmatization)
- [x] POS tags from odyCy. These may not always agree with Perseus (in some cases, where Perseus completely differs). I have used some scripts to detect proper nouns, and these won't always be reflected in the POS tag (so this is very WIP).
- [ ] Add other morph tagging.
- [ ] Add dependency trees?
- [ ] Add a license (need to confirm any restrictions and try to be compatible)

# Tagged Apostolic Fathers

The goal here is to tag the text that has been cleaned up at <https://github.com/jtauber/apostolic-fathers>

TODO List:

 - [X] Give lemmas to all words that `morpheus` provides only one headword for
 - [ ] Draw the rest of the owl
 - [ ] Add a license (need to confirm any restrictions and try to be compatible)

I have morphological tagging based on <https://github.com/chrisdrymon/angel>. This might help pick headwords/inflections but it still won't be perfect. Perhaps 90% will be good enough, though. Already, it's looking decent having 80% of words with lemmas and many that have obvious lemmas missing them (such as definite articles and common words θεος).
